Uridium
===================================

Uridium is a top-down dungeon-crawler written in Java. It was created in a team
of 6 in my second year at university. It was the assignment for my team project
module.

Project Specification
---------------

For this module you will produce a video game in a team using Java. You must use Java. Each team
will produce its own game. The exact type of game that each team makes is to be decided by the team.
However, each game must have certain core features. These are listed below.

Your team can decide which type of game you want to make. However, it must have the following core
features. How these are re
ected in your game depend on the type of game that you decide to make. They
will not be the same for each team.

**1. Competitive play.** Your game must allow multiple players to compete with each other. You can also,
optionally, include co-operative modes.

**2. Networking.** Your game must allow multiple players to play across a network on different ma-
chines. The specific networking arrangement depends on the type of game but, for example, you might
create a client-server type arrangement in which multiple clients connect to a server that controls the game.

**3. Artificial Intelligence.** Your game must have computer-controlled players. They do not need to be
present in all game modes but they must be available in at least one game mode. The computer-controlled
players might be individuals or teams, depending on the type of game. Your game may have only one
game mode but sometimes there will be multiple game modes - each one have different objectives, etc.

**4. User Interface.** Your game must have a user interface, i.e. a convenient way for players to interact
with the game. This will almost certainly require a menu as a minimum but will more than likely also
require other interface entities such as dialog windows that have a range of controls, clickable icons, etc.
The user interface will also include crucial feedback information for the player.

**5. Audio.** Your game should include audio in the form of music and spot effects, as a minimum. You
must be able to switch the music off!
